Q2
Big data is a term for data sets that are so large or complex that traditional
data processing applications are inadequate. Big Data refers to humongous volumes
of data that cannot be processed effectively with the traditional applications 
that exist.

Q3
Instead of relying on expensive, proprietary hardware and different
systems to store and process data, Hadoop enables distributed parallel processing of huge
amounts of data across inexpensive, industry-standard servers that both store and process
the data, and can scale without limits. It has two main parts; a data processing
framework (MapReduce) and a distributed file system (HDFS) for data storage. 
These are the components that are at the heart of Hadoop and really make 
things happen.
